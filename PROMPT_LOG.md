## Prompt 1

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt name:** Concept Map
- **What I sent:**

```
Create a concept map showing how these three design movements relate to each other: 1. Bauhaus (1919–1933) 2. International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s) 3. Grunge Typography Show: key figures, core principles, what each movement inherited from or rejected about the previous one. Use plain text with indentation — no images.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

I got a tree like structure of the concept map for the 3 movements but it was a little lengthy. 

- **What I did with it:**

I asked: can you make the concept map more streamlined with 5-6 lines per style? It then returned a better version that can be used.

## Prompt 2

- **Phase: Production**
- **Prompt name: Draft Labels**
- **What I sent:**

```
Read my AGENTS.md and write 3 Curator Cards into the existing index.html

Each card must follow this exact schema:

Title: Movement name and date range
Body: 80–120 words, museum-label tone (authoritative, precise, no fluff)
Tags: exactly 5 domain-specific vocabulary terms
Examples: 2 real links to museum collections or credited archives
Confusion: "Not to be confused with ___ because ___."
Accountability: "I verified this by checking [source]."
Use ONLY the vocabulary from my controlled vocabulary list.
If you are unsure about any fact, write VERIFY instead of guessing.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**
The AI agent first created the 3 cards using the vocab terms and website resources. It then confirmed if the URLs were active and applied the 3 cards to index.html with the correct formatting. There was an issue with the "Not to be confused with…" section since it focused on Grunge music instead of another typography style that was similar to Grunge.

- **What I did with it:**
I asked: fix the "not to be confused with" for Grunge. use a similar typography style that may be confused with Grunge. The agent fixed the issue and used New Wave typography because they were both opposing the Swiss style.

## Prompt 3

- **Phase: Critique**
- **Prompt name: Critique Prompt**
- **What I sent:**

```
Review my Curator Card about Grunge Typography as if you were David Carson.

Using only David Carson's documented writings, teachings, and known positions:

What would they praise about this description?
What would they challenge or correct?
Is the vocabulary appropriate to how they discussed design?
What is missing that they would consider essential?
If you are unsure about a fact or attribution, write VERIFY instead of guessing.
Do not invent quotes. Do not fabricate anecdotes.

Grunge typography emerged in the late 1980s as a rejection of Swiss Style's Rationalism. David Carson (Ray Gun) and the Cranbrook Academy circle embraced Typographic Deconstruction — breaking rules of alignment, spacing, and Typographic Hierarchy that modernism codified. Vernacular Appropriation pulled raw, non-professional visual language into print. Textural Distressing — photocopier degradation, hand-altered letterforms, layered noise — pushed type toward the Legibility Threshold, testing how far text could fragment before meaning collapsed. The Anti-Grid governed layouts, rejecting systematic structure for intuitive placement. Rooted in Postmodernism, grunge questioned whether clarity was design's only purpose.

Tags: Typographic Deconstruction · Vernacular Appropriation · Textural Distressing · Anti-Grid · Legibility Threshold

Examples:

Emigre Fonts — Digital Type Foundry Archive
AIGA Eye on Design: Cranbrook's Design Program
Not to be confused with New Wave typography (Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman), because while both challenged Swiss Style's Rationalism, New Wave retained formal compositional control and treated rule-breaking as structured experimentation, whereas Grunge embraced Vernacular Appropriation and Textural Distressing to deliberately erode legibility.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**
The agent used published interview, a TED talk, and a book with Carson's positions on the Grunge style to critique the card. The two most important issues were separating Carson from Cranbrook Academy students since they had different workflow processes and also rephrasing the stance on legibility to more accurately represent his position.

- **What I did with it:**
Based on the feedback, I asked the AI agent to change the card content in the "Implement the Feedback" prompt. The response fixed the issues by differentiating between Carson and Cranbrook Academy students and also by not using anti-legibility wording.
