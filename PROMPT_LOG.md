## Prompt 1

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt name:** Concept Map
- **What I sent:**

```
Create a concept map showing how these three design movements relate to each other: 1. Bauhaus (1919–1933) 2. International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s) 3. Grunge Typography Show: key figures, core principles, what each movement inherited from or rejected about the previous one. Use plain text with indentation — no images.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

I got a tree like structure of the concept map for the 3 movements but it was a little lengthy. 

- **What I did with it:**

I asked: can you make the concept map more streamlined with 5-6 lines per style? It then returned a better version that can be used.
