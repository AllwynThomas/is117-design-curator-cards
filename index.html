      <h2>Bauhaus</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1919–1933</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, the Bauhaus school merged fine art, craft, and industrial production into a unified pedagogical system. Students entered through the Vorkurs, a foundation course in materials, form, and color that eliminated academic ornamentation. The principle of Form Follows Function demanded that every design decision serve a practical purpose. Faculty including László Moholy-Nagy and Josef Albers advanced Functionalism across furniture, architecture, and typography. The school pursued a Gesamtkunstwerk — architecture, textiles, metalwork, and graphic design unified under one rational framework. Its promotion of the Universal Typeface, clean sans-serif letterforms, standardized visual communication for industrial mass production.</p>

    <!-- Card 2: Swiss Style -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Swiss Style</h2>
      <p class="date-range">International Typographic Style · 1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Emerging from Basel and Zürich in the 1950s, Swiss Style codified graphic design as a discipline of precision. Practitioners including Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann built layouts on the Modular Grid, dividing the page into consistent spatial units. Objective Typography replaced expressive lettering with Sans-Serif Modernism — Helvetica (1957) became the movement's defining instrument. Typographic Hierarchy governed every composition: size, weight, and position guided the reader without ambiguity. Asymmetrical Layout balanced visual tension without relying on mirrored symmetry. Photographic imagery supplanted illustration. The result was Visual Neutrality — design that foregrounded content over the designer's personal expression.</p>

      <p class="card-meta confusion">
        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Bauhaus, because while Bauhaus explored Functionalism across art, architecture, and industrial craft, Swiss Style narrowed that focus to graphic communication — specifically the organization of typography and image on a printed page.

    <!-- Card 3: Reaction (choose New Wave OR Grunge) -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Grunge Typography</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1980s–1990s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Grunge typography emerged in the late 1980s as a direct rejection of Swiss Style's Rationalism. Designers including David Carson (<cite>Ray Gun</cite> magazine) and the Cranbrook Academy circle embraced Typographic Deconstruction — breaking rules of alignment, spacing, and Typographic Hierarchy that modernism had codified. Vernacular Appropriation pulled raw, non-professional visual language into printed design. Textural Distressing — photocopier degradation, hand-altered letterforms, layered noise — pushed type toward the Legibility Threshold, testing how far text could fragment before meaning collapsed. The Anti-Grid governed layouts: compositions rejected systematic structure in favor of intuitive placement. Rooted in Postmodernism, grunge questioned whether clarity was design's only valid purpose.</p>

      <p class="card-meta confusion">
        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> grunge music (Nirvana, Pearl Jam), because while both shared a 1990s countercultural ethos, grunge typography refers specifically to a visual language of Typographic Deconstruction that developed independently within design education and publishing.
