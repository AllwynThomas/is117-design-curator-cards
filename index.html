      <h2>Bauhaus</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1919–1933</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, merging fine art, craft, and industrial production into one pedagogical system. Students entered through the Vorkurs, a foundation course in materials, form, and color that stripped academic ornamentation. Form Follows Function demanded every design decision serve practical purpose. Faculty including László Moholy-Nagy and Josef Albers advanced Functionalism across furniture, architecture, and typography. The school pursued a Gesamtkunstwerk: architecture, textiles, metalwork, and graphic design unified under one rational framework. Promotion of the Universal Typeface — clean sans-serif letterforms — standardized visual communication for mass production.</p>

    <!-- Card 2: Swiss Style -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Swiss Style</h2>
      <p class="date-range">International Typographic Style · 1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Emerging from Basel and Zürich in the 1950s, Swiss Style codified graphic design as a discipline of precision. Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann built layouts on the Modular Grid, dividing pages into consistent spatial units. Objective Typography replaced expressive lettering with Sans-Serif Modernism — Helvetica (1957) became its defining instrument. Typographic Hierarchy governed every composition: size, weight, and position guided the reader without ambiguity. Asymmetrical Layout balanced visual tension without mirrored symmetry. Photography supplanted illustration. The result was Visual Neutrality — design that foregrounded content over personal expression.</p>

        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Bauhaus, because while Bauhaus explored Functionalism across art, architecture, and industrial craft, Swiss Style narrowed that focus to graphic communication — specifically the organization of typography and image on a printed page.

    <!-- Card 3: Reaction (choose New Wave OR Grunge) -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Grunge Typography</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1980s–1990s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Grunge typography emerged in the late 1980s as a rejection of Swiss Style's Rationalism. At Cranbrook Academy, designers like Ed Fella applied Typographic Deconstruction through academic theory. David Carson (<cite>Ray Gun</cite>), working intuitively without formal training, broke rules of alignment, spacing, and Typographic Hierarchy through editorial instinct — his layouts responded to content, not formula. Vernacular Appropriation pulled raw, non-professional visual language into print. Textural Distressing — photocopier degradation, hand-altered letterforms, layered noise — pushed type toward the Legibility Threshold. The Anti-Grid rejected systematic structure for intuitive placement. Rooted in Postmodernism, grunge argued that emotional resonance, not optical clarity, defines whether design communicates.</p>

        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> New Wave typography (Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman), because while both challenged Swiss Style's Rationalism, New Wave retained formal compositional control and treated rule-breaking as structured experimentation, whereas Grunge prioritized emotional resonance over optical clarity through Vernacular Appropriation and Textural Distressing.
