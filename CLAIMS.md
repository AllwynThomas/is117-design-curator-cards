## Card 3: Grunge

### Claim 1

- **Source link(s):** https://www.ted.com/talks/david_carson_design_and_discovery
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** David Carson's 2003 TED talk "Design and Discovery" argued that legibility and communication are not the same thing. Design that is technically readable but emotionally flat fails to communicate, while design that disrupts conventional clarity can still resonate.
