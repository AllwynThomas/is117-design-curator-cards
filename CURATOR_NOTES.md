## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1. The Bauhaus style was combining the arts with functionality for objects that can be used practically and also look aesthetically pleasing.
2. The Swiss International style focuses on readability through sans-serif typography and minimalism to keep the reader's attention on what is important.
3. The Grunge style uses different font sizes and has a rough, chaotic look that opposed to cleanliness of the Swiss International style.

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. Did artists think of an object or the design to put on a object first when using the Bauhaus style?
2. Why was serif typography not included in the Swiss International style?
3. Why is the Grunge style not as popular today compared to the Swiss International style?
4. How has advancements in technologies affected the growth and usage of these three different styles?

## VOCABULARY I NEED BEFORE I CAN WRITE

```
List the domain terms you need to learn.
If you cannot define it in one sentence, you do not know it yet.
```

1. Grid System - how do you know where to place text, images, and shapes in the grid?
2. Objective Typography - what is it and its purpose?
3. Material Honesty - what is it and its purpose?
4. Gesamtkunstwerk (Total Work of Art) - what is it?
5. Anti-aliasing - I have heard of but not in a typography context
6. Layered Type - what is it and its purpose?
7. Postmodernism - what is it?

## PINNED: CONFUSIONS AND BOUNDARIES

Pin the distinctions that surprised you or corrected you.

1. Bauhaus vs. Art Deco

People confuse them because both use geometric forms and emerged in the early 20th century. But Bauhaus is about functionalism, reduction, and social idealism—design serving industry and everyday life—while Art Deco embraces luxury, ornament, glamour, and symmetry. If it feels machine-made and socially utopian, it’s Bauhaus; if it feels sleek, decorative, and luxurious, it’s likely Art Deco.

2. Swiss Style vs. Minimalism

People assume that anything clean and simple is Swiss. Swiss International Style is specifically about grid systems, asymmetrical layouts, sans-serif typography (often Helvetica), and objective clarity, whereas Minimalism is a broader artistic philosophy of extreme reduction across disciplines. Swiss Style still values structured communication; Minimalism may remove structure entirely in pursuit of purity.

3. New Wave vs. Grunge Typography

Both reject Swiss order, so they get lumped together as “messy experimental typography.” New Wave Typography plays with spacing, layering, and grid distortion but is still conceptually controlled and modernist at its core. Grunge Typography embraces rawness, texture, illegibility, and emotional chaos—less about formal experimentation, more about anti-establishment attitude.

4. Swiss Style vs. Bauhaus

People think Swiss Style is just Bauhaus continued. While Bauhaus laid the foundation with functionalism and sans-serif type, Swiss International Style systematized those ideas into strict grid-based graphic communication decades later. Bauhaus is a school and philosophy spanning architecture, product design, and art; Swiss Style is a highly refined graphic design methodology.

## DECISIONS

| Decision | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Grunge | I chose Grunge because I was interested by how it opposes the status quo of legibility that most styles embrace. The style is more about invoking emotion rather than focusing on the text. |
| David Carson | He pioneered Grunge typography by using the Macintosh to distort text and images digitally in a way that did not follow traditional grid patterns in order to show how typography can be used as art that makes people feel emotions. |

## THINGS I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT

```
After research, what did you reverse on? If nothing, you were not
paying attention or you already knew everything. Pick one.
```

1. I thought most company logos used minimalistic styles but now know they could also be using swiss international since both styles are not the same. For example, minimalistic styles do not need to follow a mathematical grid system.
2. I thought the main purpose of typography was to convey information to the reader. However, after learning more about the Grunge style, I now know that typography can also be used as an art medium with the main purpose of invoking emotions.
